                    <h4 class="font-alt" >Admission Requirements</h4>
                    <p>Postgraduate Diploma in Journalism programmes in Broadcast Media and in Print & Convergence Media are open to (i) applicants who already have an undergraduate or bachelor's degree or (ii) applicants who are final year undergraduate or bachelor's degree students, who will have completed all requirements towards their degree prior to August 15, 2016.</p>
                    <p>The field of journalism thrives on diversity, and benefits from a multiplicity of experiences and viewpoints. We encourage applicants from a wide range of professional and educational backgrounds. Prior education or professional training in journalism is not required. Admissions to National School of Journalism, Bangalore (NSoJ) are very competitive. Our selection panel must choose from a large pool of well-qualified candidates. In evaluating applications, the selectors primarily take into consideration essays submitted as part of the Admission Application and Assessment Form. Selectors will also take into consideration academic and relevant extra-curricular achievements and any prior journalistic work such as published articles, blog posts, podcasts or other broadcast material.</p>

                    <p>Admissions for the postgraduate diploma in journalism (P.G.D.J.) programmes for 2015-16 are now open. We do not think that subjecting candidates to a one-size-fits-all entrance test is the best way to identify journalistic talent. We have instead adopted an admissions process that is used by leading universities in the world. We carefully assess applicants by requiring them to complete and submit an Admission Application and Assessment Form that is designed to draw out applicants' individual strengths, merits and talents.</p>
                    <p>Shortlisted candidates will be informed by e-mail, and will be required to participate in a personal or telephonic interview before an offer of admission can be made.</p>
                    <p>Successful applicants who have not yet been awarded their undergraduate degrees will be given offer letters that are conditional on them completing all requirements towards their degrees by August 15, 2016, i.e., passing all examinations and completing course work.</p>
